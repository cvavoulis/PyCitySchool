# PyCitySchool
## Project Description
I will be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance. By using pandas, I was able to create informative data frames. 


This repo contains a Jupyter notebook file that analyzes a set of school district data, incluing student scores, school budgets, and school sizes, based on the district as a whole, individual schools and students, and different types of schools. For example, one section involves analyzing student passing rates at each school based on the number of students attending that school.

##Prerequisites
CSV files schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv can be found in the Resources folder and are required for the notebook to run properly. All output will occur in Jupyter, which can be run in an Anaconda.

##Built With
Python (Jupyter, Pandas)
