# PyCitySchool
## Project Description
I will be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
